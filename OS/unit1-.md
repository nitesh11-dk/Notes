### **7. Working of Virtual Machines**

- A hypervisor (virtual machine monitor) enables virtualization by managing VMs.
- Types of Hypervisors:
  1. **Type-1 (Bare Metal)**: Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
  2. **Type-2 (Hosted)**: Runs on top of an OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

### **8. Benefits and Challenges of Virtual Machines**

#### **Benefits**
1. **Resource Utilization**: Efficiently utilize physical hardware.
2. **Isolation**: Separate environments prevent system-wide crashes.
3. **Scalability**: Easily create and manage multiple VMs.

   - **BASH (Bourne Again Shell)** is a command-line interpreter for Linux.
   - It allows users to write scripts for task automation.

2. **Basic Syntax**:
   - Script begins with `#!/bin/bash`.
   - Commands are executed sequentially.

3. **Example Script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

### **Working of Virtual Machines (VMs) - Short Explanation**

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs its own operating system (guest OS) and applications, but on virtualized hardware managed by a **hypervisor**. The hypervisor is responsible for creating and managing VMs by abstracting physical resources like CPU, memory, storage, and I/O devices, and allocating them to each VM.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Hypervisor**: Software that runs on the physical machine (host) and manages VMs. There are two types:
   - **Type-1**: Runs directly on the hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
   - **Type-2**: Runs on top of a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox).

2. **Guest OS**: The operating system that runs inside the VM, unaware that it's virtualized.

3. **Host Machine**: The physical machine providing resources for the VMs.

4. **Virtual Hardware**: The hypervisor creates virtual CPUs, memory, storage, and I/O devices for each VM.

#### **Working**:
- **Resource Allocation**: The hypervisor allocates physical resources (CPU, RAM, disk) to each VM.
- **CPU Virtualization**: VMs use virtual CPUs (vCPUs) that the hypervisor maps to physical CPUs.
- **Memory Virtualization**: Each VM gets virtual memory, and the hypervisor manages the mapping to physical memory.
- **I/O Virtualization**: Virtual devices are created for the guest OS, which interact with actual hardware through the hypervisor.

VMs allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, offering isolation, flexibility, and efficient resource utilization.
